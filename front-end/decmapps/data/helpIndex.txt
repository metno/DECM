Standardized precipitation index (SPI) is a meteorological drought index, which describes how much precipitation (P) - possibly accumulated over a number of months - differs from the median precipitation in a reference period in the units of standard deviation.

Standardized precipitation and evapotranspiration index (SPEI) is similar to SPI, but is based on the difference between the accumulated precipitation and potential evapotranspiration (PET), P-PET. Thus, SPEI incorporates the effect of temperature variations to water availability indirectly in its calculations.
